I learned the basics of bashscript and python and how to use terminaal and command prompt, about git hub and git commands,
how to do deal with pixels in image and RPG values, about markdown. Also the importance of analytical approach in problem solving - 
initially I found all the questions new and very difficult ,but later when I studied about the things required to solve the questions,
I was able to solve and code for the questions, it was interesting and challenging.
(question 1 and 2 has been done in q2)
